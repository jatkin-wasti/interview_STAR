## Agile
**What is Agile?**
- Agile is a methodology that allows for rapid delivery of increments throughout the development of a product
. Therefore allowing for frequent internal and external feedback to guide the process.
- S: During my training with Sparta Global we were often set small tasks to be completed individually
- T: One such task was writing a short Elevator's Pitch to sell ourselves to clients
- A: I completed this and then performed my pitch to the rest of the class to get rapid feedback on
 my work
- R: This meant that I could improve my pitch based on feedback as early as possible, leading to a more engaging
 iteration that would successfully highlight my strengths.

**What are the agile values?**
- The agile values are a set of priorities that should be understood in an agile environment. They are prioritising
 individuals and interactions over processes and tools, working software over comprehensive documentation, customer
  collaboration over contract negotiation, and responding to change over following a plan. 

**What are the agile principles?**
- The agile principles are a set of guiding principles that help to easily identify an Agile environment and hold
 your project to the Agile mark. 

**Agile vs V model vs Waterfall**
- Waterfall: Series of linear sequential phases where each phase relies on the previous phase. This isn't very
 flexible or iterative as progress flows down the model. Useful to keep up momentum on a project if employees leave
, as their understanding and knowledge is preserved in the thorough documentation required. Can be suitable in
  fields where requirements and technology are fixed and unlikely to change.
- V model: Linear phases that are linked to a corresponding test phase. Verification occurs against the
 requirements and validation occurs against the user needs. This helps to avoid the downward flow of defects. Can be
  used in smaller projects that have clearly defined requirements.
- Agile: Linear phases in a continuous improvement cycle where each cycle is much shorter than in other models. Can
 be used in areas where change is expected or on new projects with a suitable team. 

**What are user and epic stories?**
- User stories are a series of low level requirements or requests from a user's perspective that can be completed in
 a sprint. Format is "As a [type of user], I want to [action] so that [outcome]."
- An Epic story is a large body of work that is much larger in scope, usually large enough to not be completable in a 
single sprint.
- High level functional and non-functional (technical) requirements from a business user's perspective.
- These are useful to cover the functionality of a product and in estimating the time and budget required for these 
large scale features.
- Can be used when discussing the project with stakeholders as it is more of an overview which will be easier to 
understand without a technical background.
### Scrum

 project in an Agile way.
